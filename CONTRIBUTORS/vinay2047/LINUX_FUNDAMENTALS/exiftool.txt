COMMAND: exiftool

DESCRIPTION:
ExifTool is a powerful command-line utility used to read, write, and analyze metadata from files.
It supports a wide range of file formats including images, videos, PDFs, and audio files.
In cybersecurity, CTFs, OSINT, and forensics challenges, exiftool is commonly used to extract hidden
information such as GPS coordinates, usernames, device details, timestamps, and sometimes embedded flags.

USAGE:
exiftool [options] <file_or_directory>

COMMON AND USEFUL FLAGS:

1. -all
Displays all available metadata from a file.
This is usually the first flag to use in CTF challenges.
Example:
exiftool -all image.jpg

2. -gps*
Extracts GPS-related metadata such as latitude, longitude, and altitude.
Useful in OSINT challenges involving location tracking.
Example:
exiftool -gps* photo.jpg

3. -Author / -Creator
Shows author or creator information embedded in files like PDFs or images.
Example:
exiftool -Author document.pdf

4. -DateTimeOriginal
Displays the original creation date and time of an image.
Useful for timeline-based forensic analysis.
Example:
exiftool -DateTimeOriginal image.jpg

5. -FileType
Identifies the actual file type, even if the extension is misleading.
Helpful when files are disguised.
Example:
exiftool -FileType suspicious_file

6. -r
Recursively scans directories and extracts metadata from all supported files.
Example:
exiftool -r images/

7. -s
Displays short output format (suppresses descriptions).
Useful for scripting and cleaner output.
Example:
exiftool -s image.jpg

CTF AND CYBERSECURITY USE CASES:
- Extracting hidden flags stored in image metadata
- Finding GPS coordinates in OSINT challenges
- Identifying usernames, device models, or software versions
- Forensic analysis of images, videos, and documents
- Detecting tampered or edited files

NOTES:
- ExifTool does not modify files unless write flags are explicitly used
- Always check metadata before attempting steganography
- Combine with tools like strings, binwalk, and steghide for deeper analysis
